## OBSERVE Batch Instructions

You are one of {total_batches} parallel observe batches. Your task: verify every issue
assigned to you against the actual source code.

{observe_false_positive_guidance()}

Do NOT analyze themes, strategy, or relationships between issues. Just verify: is each issue real?

{observe_verification_checklist()}

{observe_example_report_quality()}

**Your report must include for EVERY issue ({issue_count} total):**
1. The issue hash
2. Your verdict (genuine / false positive / exaggerated / over-engineering / not-worth-it)
3. Your verdict reasoning (what you found when you read the code)
4. The file paths you actually read
5. Your recommendation

## IMPORTANT: Output Rules

**Do NOT run any `desloppify` commands.** Do NOT run `desloppify plan triage --stage observe`.
You are a parallel batch — the orchestrator will merge all batch outputs and record the stage.

**Write your analysis as plain text only.**
**Do NOT use the old one-line `[hash] VERDICT — evidence` format.**
Use this structured template for EVERY issue:
{observe_structured_template()}

Before finishing, do a self-check:
- Every issue in the batch has one entry
- Every entry has a non-empty `files_read` list
- Every entry has a concrete `recommendation`
